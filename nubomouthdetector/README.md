===============
this module is in charge of detecting mouths. For that purpose, you need to install or use the NUBOMEDIA [NUBOMEDIA] platform.

What is Kurento
---------------

NUBOMEDIA is the first cloud platform specifically designed for hosting interactive multimedia services. 
NUBOMEDIA exposes to developers PaaS APIs for creating media pipelines. A media pipeline is a chain of 
elements providing media capabilities such as encryption, transcoding, augmented reality or video content 
analysis. These chains allow building arbitrarily complex media processing for applications. As a unique 
feature, from the point of view of the pipelines, the NUBOMEDIA cloud infrastructure behaves as a single
 virtual super-computer encompassing all the available resources of the physical network.

In particular, this part of the project is in charge of the computer vision technology, through which the
 developers can apply different computer vision filters to their pipelines.
